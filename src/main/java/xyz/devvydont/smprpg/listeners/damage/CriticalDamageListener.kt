/**
 * When this listener is initialized, the plugin will listen for "critical" damage events, and set the event to be
 * critical as a result. Whether this listener is enabled basically decides if critical hits are enabled or not.
 * This listener is in charge of the following mechanics:
 * - Apply the critical flag when manual melee crits occur by jumping and attacking.
 * - Apply the critical flag when manual bow/arrow crits occur by shooting fully charged shots.
 * - Apply the critical flag when auto crit chance procs for all melee hits. (Crit Chance % attribute).
 * - Apply the critical flag when auto crit chance procs for all bow shots (Crit Chance % attribute).
 * - Apply critical damage when critical flag is present by viewing an entity's Crit Rating attribute.
 * - Make the visuals known that the event was critical via particles and sounds.
